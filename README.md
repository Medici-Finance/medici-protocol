# Medici Finance

Providing uncollateralized loans using on-chain reputation.

Medici-finance is a Defi lending project which allows you to take loans without posting collateral based on your on-chain reputation. It does so by having a lending pool between borrowers and approvers with on-chain reputation connected to your WorldID.
